# Overview
This project is aimed at developing a loan approval system using machine learning algorithms. The system analyzes various factors such as applicant's credit score, income, employment history, and other relevant data to determine whether to approve or reject a loan application.

Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to automate the loan approval process, making it more efficient and objective. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a system that can accurately assess loan applications while minimizing the risk for the lending institution.

# Features
Utilizes machine learning algorithms for loan application evaluation.
Provides accurate predictions on loan approval/rejection based on input data.
Offers insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions.
Allows for customization and integration with existing loan processing systems.
# Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Steps to Develop the Loan Approval System
### Converting Dependent Column into Integer or Float:
 - Ensure the dependent variable is in a numerical format suitable for modeling.

### Removing Null Values:
 - Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.

### Checking the Distribution of Few Columns:
  - Visualize the distribution of relevant columns to determine the appropriate imputation method.
### Imputing Missing Values:
 - Impute missing values based on the distribution analysis.

### Outlier Analysis:
 - Identify and remove outliers from relevant columns.

### Label Encoding:
 - Convert categorical variables into numerical format if needed.

### Checking Important Columns for the Model:
 - Identify the most important features for the model.

### VIF (Variance Inflation Factor):
 - Check for multicollinearity among independent variables.

### RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination):
 - Select the most important features for the model.

### Building the Model:
 - logistic Regression :

## GOT 86% accuracy
